<p>Generally, Monday mornings are reserved for large groups, but we are happy to make accommodations for other days and times. Group requests should be made <b>two weeks in advance.</b></p>
<p>Accommodations for changes made less than 48 hours before your visit may not be feasible.</p>
<p>Please notify group visit coordinator Jessica Gatto of any changes as soon as possible.</p>

Visits typically consist of:
  <ol>An hour-long information session with an admissions counselor</ol>
  <ol>A 90-minute walking tour of campus</ol>

<p>*Accommodations can be made to eat on campus if needed; we can provide you with lunch options and prices. </p>
