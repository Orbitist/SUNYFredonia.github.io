The Governor has ordered the NYS Thruway to be closed as of midnight tonight until further notice from the Henrietta exit (#46) to the Pennsylvania line, due to the pending lake effect storm. The forecast calls for heavy snow, high winds and bitter cold temperatures, dropping two to three feet of snow south and east of Buffalo. The snow is expected to start later tonight and last through Saturday afternoon.

As a result, all students and campus personnel should be alerted to the _possibility_ that the campus may be closed by the Governor tomorrow, but that is not a foregone conclusion. Employees should use their judgment about traveling to and from campus, based on where they live and the conditions and driving bans that may be in effect. Those who stay at home would charge accruals. Essential employees should report to campus.

Please continue to monitor email and the Cancellations and Emergencies website to receive updates as they are available.
